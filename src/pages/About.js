    return <><h1>About Us</h1><p>We are a team of passionate STEM students, each driven by a desire to make a difference and give back to the community. Some of us know firsthand how challenging it can be to come to a new country, to navigate unfamiliar systems, to try to find resources and opportunities while feeling lost in the process. Others have grown up in Miami, a city that thrives on its immigrant communities, and weâ€™ve seen up close the struggles many face despite the wealth of opportunities around them.
